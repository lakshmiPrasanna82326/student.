                   <p id="eng1P">Engineers' Day is a day to celebrate the achievements of engineers and their contributions to society. It is celebrated on September 15th each year in India to commemorate the Birth of Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, a renowned engineer and statesman considered the "Father of Modern India".
                    Engineers' Day was first celebrated in India in 1960, on the 100th anniversary of Visvesvaraya's Birth. The day was chosen to honour Visvesvaraya's contributions to the field of engineering, as well as his role in the development of modern India.
